## Lab 8
Created an AutoCompleter Interface that had the following methods implemented:
* **boolean add(String word)** â€” returns true if word is added to the object (a word should not be added if it is already in the auto completer). If word is null or an empty string, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
